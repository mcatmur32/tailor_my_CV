{"opening_paragraph":"I am writing to apply for the Macquarie Asset Management Graduate Programme 2026. I am an MPhys Physics student at the University of Warwick (expected First, graduating July 2026) and am excited by Macquarie’s long-term, client-focused approach to managing critical infrastructure and delivering positive outcomes. My background in large-scale numerical modelling, data-driven optimisation and project leadership—combined with a readiness to learn financial techniques—positions me to contribute to transaction work, asset analysis and risk assessment from day one.","core_paragraphs":"During a ten-week internship in MBDA’s Modelling and Algorithms team I implemented an FFT-based optimisation to a matched-filter routine that reduced runtime by 85%, integrated mid-fidelity algorithms into a data-analysis application used by colleagues, and presented results to technical staff. Those experiences taught me how to translate mathematical methods into robust, user-facing tools—skills directly applicable to supporting transactions, building valuation or monitoring tools, and producing clear client deliverables. At Warwick I have run thousands of Monte Carlo and N-body simulations, numerically solved PDEs in C for industrial heat-flow models, and evaluated over ten high-order numerical schemes to balance accuracy and computational cost. That work required rigorous validation, sensitivity testing and concise reporting—paralleling the trade-offs and risk assessment central to asset management. \n\nI have also led teams and managed projects that mirror the programme’s collaborative and client-oriented environment. As Project Manager for the Warwick Aerospace Society I coordinated a 12-person team, produced technical documentation and bills of materials, and delivered a proof-of-concept ground station under tight deadlines. As Academic Coordinator I delivered revision lectures and organised a large departmental event, refining my ability to communicate technical ideas to varied audiences. Outside coursework I built an AI-driven CV generator (Python, SQL) that tracked outcomes for users—evidence of initiative, product delivery and practical data skills. I am particularly interested in Macquarie’s infrastructure and green-investment remit (my A-level extended project examined renewable energy and climate mitigation) and am keen to apply my quantitative toolkit to creating long-term value for clients and communities.","closing_paragraph":"I am available to begin the graduate programme following graduation in July 2026 and welcome the opportunity to bring a curious, methodical and collaborative approach to Macquarie Asset Management—whether in Client Solutions or Risk. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my technical experience and leadership can support your transactions and asset stewardship objectives."}
